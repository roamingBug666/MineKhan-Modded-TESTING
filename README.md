# MineKhan-Modded-TESTING
This is a fork from a minecraft simulator (see [bottom](https://github.com/roamingBug666/MineKhan-Modded-TESTING/edit/main/README.md#the-original-code))

## To-Do

### **Overworld**
 - Add clouds
 - Dungeons with spawners that work and loot chest/s
 - Better gradients and depth to rivers/lakes/oceans
 - Implement biomes:
   * Mesa
   * Decent mountains
   * Ocean biome
   * Roofed forest
   * Bamboo forest
### **Nether**
 - Add nether mobs
   * Blazes
   * Endermen
   * Nether skeletons
   * Magma cubes (implement the splitting into smaller cubes)
   * Ghasts
   * Maybe piglins, brutes, hoglins, zoglins, etc.

### **End**
 - Add it (flatter noise for the top and a steeper noise for the underside)
 - Add the pillars
 - Add a ton of endermen

### **General**
 - Creation menu:
   * Add cheats switch
   * Add bonus chest option
 - Make mobs 2 blocks tall (no arms/legs yet)
 - Make endermen 3 blocks tall and a better aggro mechanism
 - Make mobs actually hurt the player, and spawn them only in >7 light level blocks
 - Add bread (crafted from 3 wheat)
 - Make creepers explode properly
 - Add explosion particles and effects
 - Make exploding TNT ignite (and launch) other TNT inside radius instead of destroying it too
 - Make mobs take block damage like the player (lava, magma, cacti, wither roses, etc.)
 - Pare mobs's jump heights down to 1,25 (jump over blocks with more ease but not over fences)
 - Implement at least rudimentary mob pathfinding
 - Up fences's hitbox heights to 1,5
 - Limit what forms can different blocks take (fences, slabs, stairs) to shorten the enter cycle and to actually not have glass sta
 - Add blocks:
   * Sea life blocks like coral (blocks, fans, coral)
   * Sea blocks like prismarine (stone, dark, bricks) and sea lanterns
   * Chests that can store stuff (and can be saved in the saveString)
   * Candles
   * Clay, and bricks
   * Smow, snow blocks, snow grass, powdered snow, and powdered snow in a bucket
   * Amethyst
   * Terracotta (all colors)
   * Bamboo (plant, block, door, trapdoor)
   * Kelp
   * Sugarcane
   * Sea pickle
   * Froglights (yellow, green, purple)
 - Make furnaces, looms, etc. actually rotate
